/*
 * Single Inheritance in Java â€“ Explained
 * ðŸ”¹ Definition:
 * Single Inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a child class (subclass)
 * inherits from only one parent class (superclass).
 * 
 * In Java, this means one class extends another class, and the child gets
 * access to the parent's fields and methods.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * class Parent {
 * // parent class members
 * }
 * 
 * class Child extends Parent {
 * // child class members
 * }
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Explanation:
 * Dog is a subclass that extends Animal.
 * 
 * It inherits the eat() method from Animal.
 * 
 * It defines its own method bark().
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
 * Java supports single inheritance through extends keyword.
 * 
 * The child class inherits all non-private members (methods, variables) of the
 * parent.
 * 
 * Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes (but allows multiple
 * inheritance through interfaces).
