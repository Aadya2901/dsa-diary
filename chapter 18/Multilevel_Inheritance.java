/*
 * Multilevel Inheritance in Java â€“ Explained
 * ðŸ”¹ Definition:
 * Multilevel Inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class is derived from
 * a child class which is already derived from another class.
 * 
 * It forms a chain of inheritance.
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Syntax:
 * java
 * Copy
 * Edit
 * class A {
 * // Base class
 * }
 * 
 * class B extends A {
 * // Derived from A
 * }
 * 
 * class C extends B {
 * // Derived from B (and indirectly from A)
 * }
 * 
 * ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
 * Java supports multilevel inheritance.
 * 
 * Each derived class inherits all non-private members from its superclass.
 * 
 * The inheritance can go any number of levels deep.
 * 
 * Constructors are called from top to bottom (i.e., Animal â†’ Dog â†’ BabyDog).
